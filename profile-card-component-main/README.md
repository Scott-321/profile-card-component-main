## My process

I studied the designs and decided to use position, Flex-box and Grid layout the elements. I then worte my HTML with the layout method in mind. Once the HTML was styled the page from top to bottom.

As no media queries were needed, there was no need to start mobile first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have been learning the fundamentals of Grid and I used it in this project to layout some of the elements.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to learing more about Grid  and using it in my future projects.
